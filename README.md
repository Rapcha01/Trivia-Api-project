## Full Stack API Final Project
#Full Stack Trivia
Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game, but their API experience is limited and still needs to be built out.

That where we come in! Help them finish the trivia app so they can start holding trivia and seeing who's the most knowledgeable of the bunch. The application 

1. Displays questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
3. Search for questions based on a text query string.
4. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.
This trivia app has  given me the ability to structure plan, implement, and test an API - skills essential for enabling my future applications to communicate with others.

Tasks and completed
There are TODO comments throughout project. These comments explain what tasks were solved in the project

./frontend/
./backend/
We recommend following the instructions in those files in order. This order will look familiar from our prior work in the course.

Starting and Submitting the Project
Fork the project repository and Clone your forked repository to your machine. Work on the project locally and make sure to push all your changes to the remote repository before submitting the link to your repository in the Classroom.

About the Stack
We started the full stack application for you. It is desiged with some key functional areas:

Backend
The ./backend directory contains a partially completed Flask and SQLAlchemy server. You will work primarily in app.py to define your endpoints and can reference models.py for DB and SQLAlchemy setup.

Frontend
The ./frontend directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. You will need to update the endpoints after you define them in the backend. Those areas are marked with TODO and can be searched for expediency.

Pay special attention to what data the frontend is expecting from each API response to help guide how you format your API.

View the README.md within ./frontend for more details.
